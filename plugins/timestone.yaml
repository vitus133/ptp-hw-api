# Specific pin defaults for TimeStone hardware
specificDefaults:
  # REF0 - primary ethernet reference
  REF0:
    eec:
      priority: 3   # Medium priority for ethernet sync
    pps:
      priority: 255 # PPS typically disabled for ethernet
      
  # REF2 - esync input from other subsystems
  REF2:
    eec:
      priority: 1   # High priority for esync input
    pps:
      priority: 1   # High priority for esync input
      
  # SMA connector inputs - ready to receive
  SMA1:
    eec:
      priority: 1   # Ready for high-quality external signals
    pps:
      priority: 1   # Ready for PPS signals
      
  SMA2:
    eec:
      priority: 2   # Secondary priority
    pps:
      priority: 2   # Secondary priority

  TimeStone permissive defaults:
  - Input pins enabled with priorities ready to accept signals
  - Suitable for complex timing hierarchies
  - Designed for follower subsystems in multi-tier topologies
